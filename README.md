# Social Network Api

## Description

Do you want to be able to connect with your friends and share your thoughts? This app allows you to do just that. Users can add friends and post thoughts and reactions. Only the backend has been implemented, but there are working create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.

## Installation

To install the app, download the files from the github repositiory, and then run 'npm install' to install the necessary packages to run the program.

## Usage

After the files have been installed, run the command 'npm start' to start the server. After the server has been started, a user can interact with the server though a program such as insomnia to start interacting with the database routes. The following videos demonstrate the GET, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE routes for the user and thoughts routes.

1. User Routes:
